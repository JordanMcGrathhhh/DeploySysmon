# DeploySysmon

Deploy Sysmon (semi-intelligently) through AD GPO Startup Script

## Why Should I use this? 

Deploying Sysmon is easy, updating and tuning Sysmon isn't. 

DeploySysmon has a couple features that I found useful "in the wild." If you've ever deployed Sysmon to 100+ computers, you probably will too. 

### How? 

- Architecture-aware
- Central management of configuration via network share
